    var fooddiscription = ["Adega is a high class hidden gem found in a place you wouldn't expect, currently the reservations on opentable are booked until march. I would recommend the pasteis de Bacalhau, its a nice spring salad with flavorful codfish cakes.","Cafe Rehoboth serves the best Ethopian cusine in the town.Its a family owned business, which maintaints the authenticity of the food. I would recommend their sampler dish, its enough to share with 3 people!!!","Its a very popular Tapas place in Mountain View. It has delicious Latin American food and some live music on Friday. Very lively and upbeat atmosphere. I love their sangrias and Bacon wrapped goat cheese.","This place makes the best Pani Puri in town. Pani Puri is a very famous street food of india. This is a hidden gem, tucked far far away in Fremont but so well worth the visit","Chef Chus is an amazing chineese restaurant, with many options to eat, I would reccomend the chicken chow mein, although high in calories defineitly worth it","CheeseCake Factory serves american cusine in huge portions, although this is food, I would die for a slice of Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake","Who the heck dosn't like Chipotle?! Other then A high amount of sodium and possible exposure to ecoli. I could use a nice burrito bowl with brown rice, fajita veggies, chicken, cheese, hot salsa, and some Guac. Everyone needs Some Guac in their lives ðŸ™Œ","ciceros pizza is just a regular old pizza place, But! the pizza is served flat bread, I would reccomend the bakerpride, it's a pizza that topped with sausage and veggies","Craftsman and Wolves is like food art on plate. You would be blown away by how beautiful your food can look and taste at the same time. Its a little expensive but so very worth of every penny you spend here. My favorite dish is The Rebel, its a savoury muffin filled with a soft boiled egg, ham and spring onions.","De Afghanan serves afghani food. I would recommend their meat and rice dish. The rice is cooked in chicken broth, which makes it very delicoius. The meat is very flavorful and well seasoned with authentice spices.

And ofcourse the carb overloaded Mac and Cheese is also very tasty","Falafel Stop serves Israeli food and I have heard from the native israeli people that its very much like in thier home country. I love their Chicken Shawarma plate and hummus plate. The Falafel ball are also very delicous. Their pita bread is always warm and soft, unlike a lot of other places. This is because they make their own Pita from scratch","Gayles is a cute place by capitola that offers tons of fresh baked pasteries, and warm home made foods. I would reccomend the Lemon Chicken Breast with macaroni & cheese and Sauteed Garlic Spinach","Kula is a great place to eat japanese cuisene, mainly sushi.
