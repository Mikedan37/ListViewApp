I would reccomend the pasteis de Bacalhau, its a nice spring salad with flavorful codfish cakes.","","","","Chef Chus is an amazing chineese restaurant, with many options to eat, I would reccomend the chicken chow mein, although high in calories defineitly worth it","CheeseCake Factory serves american cusine in huge portions, although this is food, I would die for a slice of Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake","Who the heck dosn't like Chipotle?! Other then A high amount of sodium and possible exposure to ecoli. I could use a nice burrito bowl with brown rice, fajita veggies, chicken, cheese, hot salsa, and some Guac. Everyone needs Some Guac in their lives ðŸ™Œ","ciceros pizza is just a regular old pizza place, But! the pizza is served flat bread, I would reccomend the bakerpride, it's a pizza that topped with sausage and veggies","","", "DishDash is a great place to eat at when you're in the mood for medditerainian food, my favorite dish is the shish touk, which is a chicken kabob with a nice aroma of spices and flavores complimented by some nice buttery basmati rice","","","Gayles is a cute place by capitola that offers tons of fresh baked pasteries, and warm home made foods. I would reccomend the Lemon Chicken Breast with macaroni & cheese and Sauteed Garlic Spinach","Kula is a great place to eat japanese cuisene, mainly sushi. This cool restaurant has sushi plates running around on little conveyor belts, id reccomend the salmon belly nigiri, its raw salmon on rice. You only live once!", "","","ShadowBrook is a great place to enjoy a meal with a significant other. I would reccomend the Shrimp Sacmpi it's nice and buttery but at the sametime sweet and creamy", "","", "I absolutly love Whole Foods, theres a variety of cooked foods, that taste just like a home made meal. I would reccomend the Citus salmon with baked cumin sweet potatoes and grilled vegetables"]
